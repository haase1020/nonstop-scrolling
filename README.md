- Scrolling fun for all!

## App Details

- This fun JavaScript project is great for learning the basics in making an API call to a popular photo website and responsively displaying those photos.
- I would like to thank [Zero To Master Academy](https://zerotomastery.io/) for providing the inspiration for this project (Infinite Scroll app in JavaScript Web Projects course). Their learning material is WONDERFUL!
- This is a great app for anyone who wants to sharpen their JavaScript skills!
